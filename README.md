### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Kanson**](https://www.zorocubing.com), a developer based in Hong Kong.

I design and build products that solves my daily problems, they could be desktop apps, web apps and vscode extensions.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is Python, HTML, CSS, and some Javascript experiences. My favorite tools are Figma, Notion, and Slack.

I’ve got a two pinned projects, clipcode which is built by me and webscraper built together with my club but my favorite is the project I'm building with my club right now [OpenDoor](https://github.com/St-Margarets-Coding-Club/opendoor).

I’ve built over 10 public repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than that at this point.

#### Fun Facts:

* I started coding in 2024
* I think AI for science is more interesting than LLMs
* a16z is my favorite Venture Capital despite not having strong portfolios like Sequoia Capital or Founders Fund
* **Hobbies:** coding, reading, dreaming
